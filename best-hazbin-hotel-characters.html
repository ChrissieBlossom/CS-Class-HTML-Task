	<h1>Best Hazbin Hotel Characters (according to me :3)</h1>

	


	<p>Hazbin Hotel is Amazon's new hit animated show, <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Zlmswo0S0e0">based on the pilot that released on YouTube 4 years ago</a>. I could write about in depth character analysis, or some of the real issues with the show...</p>
	<p>Orrrrr</p>
	
	<p>I could just collate my favourite characters :P</p>

	<ol>
		<li><a href="#alastor">Alastor</a></li>
		<li><a href="#charlie">Charlie</a></li>
		<li><a href="#lucifer">Lucifer</a></li>
	</ol>

		<h2 id="alastor">Alastor</h2>
		<p>This one's a no brainer tbh. Alastor, one of the overlords of hell is by far my favourite character. He's powerful, fruity as hell (despite being aroace, also no pun intended) and the mystery surrounding him and what he's planning is fun. He's also responsible for the infinitely better name of the Hazbin Hotel (sorry Charlie, but "Happy Hotel" is kinda crap)</p>
	

		<h2 id="charlie">Charlie</h2>
		<p>The main character herself, princess of hell, Charlie Morningstar. She's not many people's favourite (as the internet tends to have an aversion to liking the main character of any show) but I really like her! She created the Hazbin Hotel with her girlfriend Vaggie (woooo more LGBTQ representation!) which makes the foundation of the show. Her optimism is fun to watch, and the complete contrast between her personality (Disney-esque princess) compared to her environment (literal hell) is funny.</p>

	

	<h2 id="lucifer">Lucifer</h2>

	<p>Lucifer, fallen angel, rubber duck connoisseur, father of Charlie, and the King of Hell himself (check out his glowing reviews on Yelp xD)</p>
	<p>He's the complete opposite of what you'd expect from the "King of Hell". He's a short king (literally), a loveable goof ball and his obsession with ducks rivals that of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYOmtEcZ1lk">James Veitch</a></p>

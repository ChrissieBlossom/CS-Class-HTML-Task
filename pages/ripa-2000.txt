# RIPA 2000
## The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000
This law regulates how organisations can monitor communications, and covers **investigation, surveillance,** and **interception** of communication, such as "wiretapping" messages (provided a warrant has been issued)

The act enfoces ISPs to give up infromation on request from an authorised authority, such as GCHQ

## What the act allows

The following actions are allowed under the act for police and other public bodies:
[unordered]
* Demand ISPs to provide access to a customer's communications, and fir equipent that allows for it, without informing the customer
* Allow mass surveillance of communications
* Monitor an individual's internet activities
* Prevent the existence of such interception being revealed in court
* Demand that someone hand over the keys for encryption
[end]

## Monitoring

Monitoring can only be done by certain organisations, like the plice, and intelligence agecies. To do this, a warrant must be issued, though some organisations, like GCHQ and the secret services, don't need one.

These organisations are able to carry out mass surveillance and can do audits on previously held data. 

Some other agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency can also do this, but they require a court order.

## Problems

This surveilance can feel like a violation of civil liberties, and can contradict other laws like the freedom of information act. It could also lead to false positives - organisations finding communications that appear to be problematic but are in fact benign. It can also be misused, for instance it has previously been used by a local council to see if a family lives inside of the catchment area for a school.

# CS-Class-HTML-Task
This is a website created for my comp. sci. class. 

## Pseudo-markdown formatting used
The pages are rendered from txt files that contain markdown-esque formatting, but it is NOT markdown
The rules are as follows:
```
# - Heading 1
## - Heading 2
...etc to heading 6

[unordered]/[ordered] - starts a an ordered or unorderd list respectively

* - list item, this applies for both unordered AND unordered lists

[end] - ends list

[img](image/location) - creates an image
[example](https://example.com) - hyperlink, can alsouse #example to create a jump point
*** NOTE *** The text for a url CANNOT be "img" as this will cause it to try and display as an image

[jump example] - jumps to this point from a link with the link being #example (see above)

*example* - italics
**example** - bold

Line breaks in the document are truncateed. If you want multiple lines between something, then I don't know, just make a line with a space on it (I'll never need to do this so I don't give a shit)
```

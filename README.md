# CS-Class-HTML-Task
This is a website created for my comp. sci. class. It isn't very complicated and honestly has pretty shoddy "programming". It's also the first HTML page I've ever made, so there's that.
If you want to see a better website, check out [my main site for my github](https://chrissieblossom.github.io/)!
